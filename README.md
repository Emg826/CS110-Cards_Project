# CS110-Cards_Project
A class project for Imperative Problem Solving (CS110).

In this project the goal was to simulate poker hands and analyze those hands to confirm the known probabilities of receiving a unique hand, one or two pairs, 3 of kind, or 4 or 5 of a kind.

This project required: 
  + Simulating a 'deck of cards' using an array and a 'hand' using the first 5 elements in that array
  + Shuffling an array for to maintain randomness
  + Collecting and analyzing the results of 1 million randomized hands
